# Manifesto

[Ribbon](https://github.com/hardBSDk) created the FOSS Supremacy organization with the purpose to recreate great game ideas, better.

Many commercial games have great game design ideas, but they lack good mechanics, performance and modding support sometimes.

Our goal is to make free games (as freedom) with good mechanics (easy and fun) and performance that the community can improve.

We also value the modding support, which increase the life of many commercial games.

We will maintain and improve our games with donations and sales on Steam and GOG.
